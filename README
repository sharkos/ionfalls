IonFalls is an unfinished project, more of a proof-of-concept, to develop a 
replacement init system for Linux systems. STOP, what about SystemD, Upstart,
sysvinit, bsd, etc?  Yes yes, those are great and work great; however solve a
traditional system startup mechanism.  IonFalls was intended to be a network
bootloader where the end-point machine boots to an agent, receives a remote
boot profile from a centralized (or distributed) datasource. 

The intent was to be able to deploy complex infrastructure quickly across
a network by defining the role at boot-time. 

While not completed, the project demonstrated a unique method of booting
a system and allowing it to await instructions from a master node. It 
also combined a series of Java based libraries imported into JRuby for
things like templates and terminal manipulation. It also demonstrated that
a machine could use a jruby program to boot rather than relying on bash
shell scripts.
